- Thank you for downloading! To begin using this application, simply run the .exe file and you can immediately begin mapping out
your keyboard and save presets for each of your favorite games. 

- Using your mouse, you can select various keys on the virtual 
keyboard. Selecting a key will cycle it from Neutral -> Positive -> Negative -> Neutral etc. Then you can save the preset for 
the next time you restart the app.

- This app plays .mp3 files, so you must own a .mp3 file copy of any songs you wish to use. If you already have music downloaded as
.wav or other audio formats, there are plenty of ways to easily convert them to .mp3. If you do not already own your favorite songs
as files on your computer, they cannot be used with this app (there are plenty of ways to get songs as .mp3, you probably already
know what I'm talking about). Once uploaded, a song can be identified as a Low/Medium/High intensity. There must be at least one song 
for each intensity, otherwise the tool will not be able to operate correctly. Once your playlist is all set, you should be good to
go! Both the playlist and keyboard settings can be changed and updated in real-time (just remember to save any changes you make).

- Adjusting the sensitivity will change how easy it is to go from low intensity to high intensity. You may want different 
sensitivity values for each game, but this can also be changed in real-time so feel free to experiment a little. The volume can also
be changed in real-time. Songs can be skipped using the "Skip" button.

- I am currently working on better GUI, and allowing the user to assign hotkeys for the Play/Stop/Skip buttons. Any other feedback
is greatly appreciated! If you are interested in the code behind everything, the Visual Studios 2019 solution is included in this 
folder, but if you don't have VS2019 you can still view the .cs and .xaml files in any text viewer.
